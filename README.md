Project is raw and being updated very rarely.
There are no optimizations, refactoring and I don't expect anyone to look at it at all.
For multiplication I have already added Karatsuba Multiplication Algorithm[1] and simplest school-like algorithm.
Plans:
- [ ] Refactor class interface
- [ ] Get rid of unnessesery copying
- [ ] Add benchmarking for multiplications: Karatsuba and school algos
- [ ] Add division
